> The current repository is part of a personal project. The main goal is to solve all app ideas from [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repo. If you like this repo and want to support this journey, be free to donate any value to BTC wallet `3DNssbspq7dURaVQH6yBoYwW3PhsNs8dnK` ‚ù§.

This repo contains a challenge proposed by [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). Border Radius Previewer allows to preview how a shape looks after applying values to border-radius style. See all challenge details [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Border-Radius-Previewer.md).

For this project the language chosen is Vue. Vue is a fast and lightweight framework and it can achieve more easily and fast goals proposed by the project. Typescript also makes part of this project to keep classes, functions, and components typed and organized.

The app has 4 inputs, each one to each border-radius corner. By updating them, a box will reply with border-radius values set. Some values may be marked as invalid since this app only allows values with pixel or percent units. After setting values, the user still can copy the CSS expression to the clipboard.
